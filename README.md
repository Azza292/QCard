## What is a "QCard"?

Essentially a wrapper around the standardised [VCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) format, But designed for maximum portability.

Let's break it down in bash:
```shell
# An entire QCard
$ echo https://qcard.now.sh/?v=QkVHSU46VkNBUkQNCk46R2l0aHViIEJyb3dzZXINClRJVExFOkludGVyZXN0ZWQgaW4gUUNhcmQNClVSTDpodHRwczovL3FjYXJkLm5vdy5zaA0KTk9URTpIZXlcLCB0aGF0J3MgbWUhDQpFTkQ6VkNBUkQ=

# The `v` parameter is Base64 encoded, decode it
$ echo "QkVHSU46VkNBUkQNCk4..." | base64 --decode

# You can save this as a `.vcf` file to import somewhere
# With a bonus bash trick for you to grab the last output.
$ echo "$(!!)" > contact.vcf
```
[Your QCard](https://qcard.now.sh/?v=QkVHSU46VkNBUkQNCk46R2l0aHViIEJyb3dzZXINClRJVExFOkludGVyZXN0ZWQgaW4gUUNhcmQNClVSTDpodHRwczovL3FjYXJkLm5vdy5zaA0KTk9URTpIZXlcLCB0aGF0J3MgbWUhDQpFTkQ6VkNBUkQ=)
